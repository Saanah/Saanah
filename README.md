# Hello! I’m Saana, an information technology student from Finland 👋
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and arts! So far I've taken a liking for frontend development (shockingly).
- 👩‍💻 Languages I've been learning and enjoying a lot include **Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Python** and of course **HTML/JSX** and **CSS.**
- ⚛️ I also really like **React** and would like to learn more about it and **Redux** in the future!
- 📅 Languages that I'm planning to learn in the near future include TypeScript and C#. I also want to revise and learn more about Android's Jetpack Compose toolkit and Google's Flutter.
- 🗄️ I'm open to learning more about backend development as well.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to improve my skills and knowledge as a programmer.
