- 👩‍💻 Languages I've been learning and enjoying a lot include **Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Python** and of course **HTML/JSX** and **CSS.**
- ⚛️ I also like **React** and would like to learn more about it and **Redux** in the future!
- 📅 Languages that I'd like to learn in the near future include TypeScript and C#. From Android's side, revise Jetpack Compose toolkit.
